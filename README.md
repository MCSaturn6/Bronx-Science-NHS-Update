# Bronx Science NHS Website

Bronx Science National Honor Society (NHS) elevates the school's commitment to the values of scholarship, service, leadership, and character. By providing volunteering opportunities around the school, such as being a tutor and tour guide, members get first-hand experience building these four skills.

Once accepted into NHS, members attend monthly meetings, typically held in the school auditorium. Members will check their emails regularly on project, service, and tutoring opportunities, dedicating an average of 1-2 hours a week on NHS.
