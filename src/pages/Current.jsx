            Tutoring non-Bronx Science students will not count towards your
            credit requirement. You must either tutor during school, during SGI,
            or tutor your matched Bronx Science student outside of school. You
            may only tutor a tutee once being matched through NHS by receiving
            the ‚ÄúTutoring Pairing Email‚Äù.
          </p>
          <p>
            Students can tutor in SGI for credit without being matched. You must
            have a teacher's signature on the tutoring log.

            Clearing Probations

          <p>
            Once you receive your third probation, you will be dismissed from
            NHS. You will not have any opportunity to reapply and will not be
            eligible to clear any of your probations.

            2 service credits will clear one probation 1 project credit will
            clear one probation These credits will not be counted towards either
            of the two categories, but rather it will only clear the probation
            You may not clear a probation with past earned service and project
            credits. Only credits awarded AFTER a probation has been received
            will be acceptable for clearance.

            in). This way, we know you have seen the information posted. (It

            Smaller events will all be found under the Service category.
            Volunteers for short-term events will be chosen on a
            first-come-first-serve basis. For example, if volunteers for a tour
            is requested within the next few days, we will need to assign
            volunteers ASAP.
          </p>
          <p>
            If it is an event in which we have more time, we will close the
            google form on a certain date and review which volunteers need the
            most service credits. (We will indicate the date of form closing.)
